# Test Address Lookup

Occasionally, you may need to check that the Google Geocoding API is returning the expected result.

In your site's control panel, go to **Utilities > Test Address Lookup**.

<img class="dropshadow" :src="$withBase('/images/guides/test-address-lookup.png')" alt="" width="700" style="margin-top:4px">

If a matching location was found, a basic map will be displayed with only a single marker. Otherwise, a simple message will state that 
_"No matching results were found"_.

**If the API key is not valid**, you'll be prompted to use the [Test Google API Keys](/guides/test-google-api-keys/) utility.
