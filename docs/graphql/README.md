# GraphQL

### Retrieving an Address field

To get all data from an Address field, see [Using an Address in GraphQL...](/address-field/graphql/)

### Custom Types

The Google Maps plugin introduces several custom GraphQL types to handle Address data.

:::warning Focus on the Address type
Most of what you need to know can be found in the `GoogleMaps_Address` type. Unless you need to dig further into the raw data, the Address type alone will cover 95% of use-cases.
:::

- [**`GoogleMaps_Address`**](/graphql/address-type/)
- [`GoogleMaps_Raw`](/graphql/raw-type/)
- [`GoogleMaps_Component`](/graphql/component-type/)
- [`GoogleMaps_Geometry`](/graphql/geometry-type/)
- [`GoogleMaps_Location`](/graphql/location-type/)
